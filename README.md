## How to run

Install dependencies
```
yarn install
```

Run in dev mode
```
yarn run dev
```

## Pre-commit

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce our `.editorconfig` (newline at EOF, no bad indentation, etc.) before code is committed.

#### One-time setup

```
# install pre-commit if you don’t already have it
pip install pre-commit       # or brew install pre-commit / pipx install pre-commit

# enable the git hook in this repo
pre-commit install

# optional: clean up the repo on demand
pre-commit run --all-files
git add -A
```

#### What happens on commit

- Auto-fixers run (e.g. add final newlines).
- After the auto-fixers, the editorconfig-checker runs inside Docker to validate all staged files.
- If violations remain, fix them manually until the commit passes.
